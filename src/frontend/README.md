# CFG Web View

This is a tool meant to help debugging the CFG generation and presentation.

Use `bun run web` to run it.

Add more samples under `./src/assets/samples/` to see them in the web view.

## TODO

- [ ] Find a better way to serve the `.wasm` files rather than sticking them in the `public` dir.
